# 🔭 Currently Working On  

## **💚 Clin+ — Smart Healthcare Management Platform**

I’m the **founder and founding engineer** of **Clin+**, a bootstrapped SaaS platform designed to modernize healthcare management in Brazil.

What started as an internal solution for a real clinic quickly evolved into a **production-ready system used by multiple clinics**.  
Clin+ focuses on **operational intelligence, automation, and real-world usability** — going beyond traditional EMR/clinic systems.

We are building a **modern, AI-powered healthcare management platform** that improves clinical operations, reduces administrative workload, and brings intelligence into daily workflows.

## 🚀 Current Product Stage

Clin+ is already **in production with real users** and continues to evolve weekly.

The platform now includes:

- Full **multi-tenant SaaS architecture**
- Web platform + **iOS & Android apps** (React Native + Expo)
- Integrated **AI features** for clinical and operational workflows
- Payments infrastructure with **PIX and Credit Card (Brazil)** including split payments
- Secure document engine with **digital signatures inside the platform**
- Role-based access control (**RBAC**) and deep permission system
- Patient portal and user environment
- Cloud storage and scalable infrastructure
