### **Clin+ â€” Healthcare Management System** ðŸ’š

I founded **Clin+** as a **bootstrapped open-source project**, where we're building a management system for clinics and hospitals in Brazil.

Our main differentiators, besides solving the usual problems of current market players (like responsiveness, security, customization, usability, and a short learning curve), include a **native payment split feature that we are currently developing** in partnership with **@woovibr**, a leading instant payment startup in Brazil.

This custom split is being designed to prevent **double taxation** on payments for treatments processed through our platform. Once implemented, it will enable automated, tax-optimized payouts directly to professionals, saving up to **20% in payment processing costs** for clinics, offices, and hospitals.

The project is currently being tested by several local clinics and receives weekly updates shared on our social media: **@clinmais**.
