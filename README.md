## 🔭 Currently Working On

### **Clin+ — Healthcare Management System** 💚

I founded **Clin+** as a **bootstrapped open-source project**, where we're building a management system for clinics and hospitals in Brazil.

Our main differentiators, besides solving the usual problems of current market players (like responsiveness, security, customization, usability, and a short learning curve).

This platform operates directly in the management of clinics and hospitals, providing a secure platform for electronic medical records, patient management, schedules, documents, medical prescriptions, certificates, and remote care.

The project is currently being tested by several local clinics and receives weekly updates shared on our social media: **@clinmais**.
